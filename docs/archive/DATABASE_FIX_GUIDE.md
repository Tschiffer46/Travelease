# Database Fix Guide - Adding Product Images

## 🐛 Issue Identified

Your site is deployed but shows no product images. This is because:
1. **Database not seeded with images** - The seed data was updated to include images, but Railway database hasn't been re-seeded
2. **Environment variables have placeholders** - Some critical variables need real values

## ✅ Solution: Re-seed Database with Images

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Login and Link to Your Project

```bash
railway login
railway link
```

Select your `travelease` project when prompted.

### Step 3: Re-seed the Database

**Using Railway CLI (Recommended Method)**

Railway CLI is the most reliable way to run database commands:

```bash
railway run npm run db:push
railway run npm run db:seed
```

**Why CLI Instead of Dashboard?**
- Railway dashboard UI changes frequently
- CLI commands are stable and well-documented
- Better error messages and feedback
- Easier to troubleshoot issues

**CLI Installation Help:**
- Main install: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- If permission errors: `sudo npm install -g @railway/cli` (Mac/Linux)
- Alternative: Download from https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli
- Need Node.js first: https://nodejs.org

### Step 4: Verify Products Have Images

After seeding, visit your site:
- https://travelease-production-a2c6.up.railway.app/products

You should now see:
- ✅ High-quality product images from Unsplash
- ✅ Proper image display on all product cards
- ✅ Image galleries on product detail pages

## 🔧 Fix Environment Variables

Your current environment variables have placeholders. Update these in Railway:

### Critical Variables to Update

1. **NEXTAUTH_URL**
   ```
   Current: https://your-app.up.railway.app
   Should be: https://travelease-production-a2c6.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**
   ```
   Current: generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32
   Generate a real secret:
   ```
   
   Run this command:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   
   Use the output as your NEXTAUTH_SECRET value.

3. **OPENWEATHER_API_KEY** (Optional but recommended for destination recommendations)
   ```
   Current: your-openweathermap-api-key
   Get a free API key from: https://openweathermap.org/api
   ```

### How to Update Variables in Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your `travelease` project
3. Click on your application service
4. Go to "Variables" tab
5. Update the variables listed above
6. Railway will automatically redeploy with new values

Image sources:

## 🎨 Expected Visual Result

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Images Still Not Showing?

**Check 1: Database was actually seeded**
```bash
railway run npx prisma studio
```
This opens Prisma Studio. Click on "Product" and verify:
- All products have `imageUrl` field filled
- URLs start with `https://images.unsplash.com/`

**Check 2: Clear browser cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or use incognito/private browsing mode

**Check 3: Check Railway logs**
```bash
railway logs
```
Look for any errors related to database or images.

### Environment Variables Not Taking Effect?

After updating variables in Railway:
1. Variables take effect on next deployment
2. Railway auto-deploys when you save changes
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Check deployment logs to verify new build

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After completing the steps above:

- [ ] Ran `railway run npm run db:seed` successfully
- [ ] Updated NEXTAUTH_URL to actual Railway URL
- [ ] Generated and set NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- [ ] (Optional) Set OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
- [ ] Visited products page and see images
- [ ] Products load without gradient placeholders
- [ ] All 18 products display properly
