BEGINNER DOCUMENTATION ISSUE - COMPLETELY RESOLVED
================================================================================

Date: 2026-02-06
Issue: User frustrated - didn't know WHERE to type commands
Status: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED

================================================================================
WHAT THE USER SAID
================================================================================

"This is NOT working. You cannot give instructions like 'install this...' 
and not describe in detail exactly where I am supposed to install. 
Do I do it in a browser? Or in the Terminal on my Mac? 
Create a description for a total beginner."

USER WAS 100% RIGHT!

- WHAT Terminal is
- WHERE to find it
- HOW to open it
- WHERE to type commands (Terminal vs Browser)
