## Why Railway CLI?

**Railway CLI is Better Because:**
- ✅ Commands are stable (don't change with UI updates)

**Railway Dashboard UI:**
- ❌ Changes frequently with updates
- ❌ Documentation becomes outdated
- ❌ Hard to provide accurate instructions
- ❌ UI varies between users

That's why we now recommend CLI only!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

Install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org
Then retry Railway CLI installation.

### Permission errors on Mac/Linux
```bash
sudo npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### CLI not installing
Try Railway's standalone installer:
